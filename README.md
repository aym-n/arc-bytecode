# Arc Bytecode

Welcome to the Arc Bytecode project! ðŸš€ This Rust-based initiative represents a bytecode implementation of the Arc Interpreter, providing a hands-on exploration into low-level programming concepts and advancing proficiency in Rust.

## Project Focus

Building upon the foundation of the [Arc Interpreter's tree-walk implementation](https://github.com/aym-n/arc), this project delves into bytecode interpretation. By translating high-level Arc code into bytecode instructions, participants gain insight into language design principles and bytecode execution.

## Learning Objectives

- **Bytecode Interpretation:** Understand the mechanics of bytecode execution and its role in optimizing language performance.
- **Rust Language Proficiency:** Enhance Rust programming skills through bytecode interpreter implementation and integration with the existing Arc Interpreter.

## Resources

- [Crafting Interpreters Book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
- [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Happy Learning!
